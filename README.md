# StreamElements Notice
The information below are just more in-depth details about what's going on and can't be done about it no matter what I do. 

### Limitation
- Most of Twitch slash (/) command won't show due to StreamElement API not retrieving it except "/me"

### Known Issues
- Community bulk gift causes long delays for other messages/alerts depending how many gifted over 25 of chat alerts & event list (simulation). Not sure if it causes an actual delay when a community bulk happens (I'm not that popular :P)

### Bugs
- Any changes saved in Event List widget, it will display random data (ex. all latest raids). Refreshing the cache/browser source fixes it
